# This module contains functions to create and manipulate an 'order' dictionary. Each order
# represents a customer order for iBIKE. Currently, the orders are generated with a random
# type and 3 random preferences from the user. The preferences will be unique for each order
# and will contain two preferences specific to the bike type and one that is independent of 
# bike type. Order will also be generate with a 'status' key that is initialized with a value
# of 'in progress'. The iBIKE game should eventually contain mechanisms to change that status to
# 'completed'
# This module is ONLY for generating a random order dictionary. group.py will
# make use of this module and will save orders to the group_state.
