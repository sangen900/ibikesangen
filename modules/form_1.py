    ("The School of Engineering is conducting an educational research study on the impact of a curriculum that integrates business with industrial knowledge and engineering (iBIKE) to improve manufacturing education (NSF funding pending). The curriculum is consisted of several modules that will be implemented in the following courses: IE 305, EE380, EE383 (lab), ME 465 (lab), ME 468, ME 469, IE 470, and MIS 404. All students enrolled in these courses are invited to participate in the study.__The purpose of the study__ is to transform manufacturing education and develop associated skills by integrating manufacturing concepts across engineering and business curriculum. The curriculum modules will be designed and improved based on student feedback over a period of three years.")

However, students will be asked to fill out a couple of short surveys before and after selected classes. Only the information of consented participants will be included in the studyâ€™s database. The information will be deidentified prior to analysis. Data will be analyzed as a group and may be used in an academic presentation or journal publication. However, no personally identifiable information will be used or shared.")
